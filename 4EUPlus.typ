= Definition
Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are a class of tensor network states that efficiently parametrise quantum states with finite entanglement. They are a generalization of Matrix Product States (MPS).

  The entanglement entropy of a region $cal(A)$ of quantum state with finite (local) entanglement scales as $partial cal(A)$, the boundary of $cal(A)$.

This is in constrast with the volume law most states follow.

Given the Schmidt decomposition of a state $|Psi angle.r$ across a bipartition of the system into the "In" system $cal(A)$ and the "Out" system $cal(B)$ (where $sum_i lambda^2_i = 1$):

$ |Psi angle.r = sum_i lambda_i |I_i angle.r times.circle |O_i angle.r $

The entanglement entropy of the region $cal(A)$ is given by:
$ S_(cal(A)) = - sum_i lambda^2_i log(lambda^2_i) $
The maximal value this can take is when all the $lambda_i = 1/N_S$, with $N_S$ the Schmidt rank.
For finitely entangled systems, $S_(cal(A))$ is thus bounded by the finite Schmidt rank $N_S$.
$ S_(cal(A)) <= log(N_S) $

It turns out that PEPS satisfy an *area law* for their entanglement entropy *by construction*. This property makes PEPS an efficient representation of quantum states with finite (local) entanglement.

The entanglement entropy of the shaded area $cal(A)$ is the sum of the entanglement entropy across the cut virtual bonds, which by construction all have a finite bond dimension (and Schmidt rank) $chi$.

The entanglement entropy of a single cut is bounded by $log(chi)$. The total entanglement entropy of the region $cal(A)$ is thus proportional to the number of cut virtual bonds times $log(chi)$.

$ S_(cal(A)) #h(10pt) ~ #h(10pt) log(chi) dot.c partial cal(A) $

Consider the same shaded region $cal(A)$ as before. The support space $cal(S)_(cal(A))$ of the reduced density matrix $rho_(cal(A))$ grows as $partial cal(A)$ while the Hilbert space $cal(H)_(cal(A))$ grows as $cal(A)$.

Therefore we can always find a sufficiently large region such that $rho_(cal(A))$ has a non-trivial kernel $ker(rho_(cal(A))) = cal(H)_(cal(A)) \\ cal(S)_(cal(A))$.

It is thus the groundstate of every Hamiltonian h with:
- $h >= 0$
- $ker(h) = cal(S)_(cal(A))$

since by construction $tr(rho_(cal(A))h) = 0$.

The Hamiltonian can be extended to the entire lattice by assigning a region $cal(R)_v$ to every vertex $v$ of the lattice and defining
$ H = sum_v h_v times.circle bb(1) $

The Hamiltonian is _local_ since it is the sum of local terms $h_v$ acting on the region $cal(R)_v$, and it is _frustration free_ since every term $h_v$ is minimized by the PEPS.
