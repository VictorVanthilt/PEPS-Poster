(Following *[Cirac et. al. 2021]*)

Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are a class of tensor network states that efficiently parametrise quantum states with finite entanglement. They are a generalization of Matrix Product States (MPS).

  [*Entanglement Area Law*
  
  The entanglement entropy of a region $cal(A)$ of quantum state with finite (local) entanglement scales as $partial cal(A)$, the boundary of $cal(A)$.],
)
This is in constrast with the volume law most states follow.
Given the Schmidt decomposition of a state $|Psi angle.r$ across a bipartition of the system into the "In" system $cal(A)$ and the "Out" system $cal(B)$:

$ |Psi angle.r = sum_i lambda_i |I_i angle.r times.circle |O_i angle.r $

The entanglement entropy of the region $cal(A)$ is given by:
$ S_(cal(A)) = - sum_i lambda^2_i log(lambda^2_i) $
As the system is only finitely entangled this is bounded by the number of Schmidt coefficients $N_S$:
$ S_(cal(A)) #h(5pt)~ log(N_S) dot.c partial cal(A) $.

It turns out that PEPS satisfy an area law for their entanglement entropy by construction. This property makes PEPS an efficient representation of quantum states with finite (local) entanglement.
